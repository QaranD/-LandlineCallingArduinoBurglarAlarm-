Project Title: Arduino Burglar Alarm with Landline Calling and Enhanced Security Features

Description:

Presenting an advanced iteration of our Arduino Burglar Alarm system, this project combines cutting-edge technology with user-friendly controls for comprehensive security solutions. The key features of this enhanced version include:

    Landline Calling with DTMF Signaling: The device is equipped with landline connectivity and utilizes Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signaling to call predefined phone numbers when triggered. This ensures prompt notifications to keep you informed of any security breaches.

    Dual Power Supply: The Burglar alarm seamlessly integrates with a 12V power supply and a 7.4V Li-ION battery configuration (two cells in series). This dual power setup guarantees uninterrupted operation, even during power outages.

    Automatic Power Source Switching: In the event of a power supply failure, the system automatically switches to the Li-ION batteries, ensuring continuous security monitoring without any interruptions.

    Battery Charging Functionality: The code includes a dedicated section for automatic charging of the Li-ION batteries, ensuring they are consistently charged and ready for use.

    Motion Detection Trigger: A Passive Infrared (PIR) motion detector, coupled with an RF 433MHz module, triggers the alarm upon detecting any motion, enhancing the system's responsiveness and reliability.

    RF433MHz Remote Controls: The project features two RF433MHz remote controls, allowing for convenient activation and deactivation of the device. This user-friendly functionality provides an added layer of control over your security system.

This open-source project offers a comprehensive solution for home or office security, integrating advanced features with seamless operation. Explore the code, customize it to your specific requirements, and experience enhanced security with this Arduino Burglar Alarm system.
